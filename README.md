## 🕵️‍♂️ About Me
<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=sbvhev&show_icons=true&icon_color=0366d6&text_color=24292e&bg_color=ffffff&hide_title=true" />
I have nearly a decade of experience in software engineering. I'm passionate about solving challenging problems that others find difficult or impossible.
I'm comfortable working independently and collaborating on teams. 
I'm well versed in front-end technologies like React, Angular, and Vue as well as many UI frameworks/libraries such as Bootstrap, Antd, Material UI, Bluprint JS, and Semantic UI.
Also, I'm a blockchain engineer with an abundance of experience in DeFi, and dApp projects as a smart contract engineer. I mostly contributed to solidity, web3, subgraph, and etherjs integration. Most recently, I got so much interested in Rust/Solana blockchain.

## 🚀 Achievements
- ⭐ Contributed to a lot of DEFI, DEX, DAPP, NFT Projects, Web and Cross mobile Applications
